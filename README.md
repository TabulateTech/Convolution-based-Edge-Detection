# Convolution-based-Edge-Detection
This code implements image edge detection using convolution and gradient techniques. It utilizes OpenCV library in C++. The program applies convolution, converts the image to grayscale, calculates gradients, and identifies edges based on a threshold. It offers a simple and efficient method for detecting edges in images.
